I fixed the screen issue for NerdMiner_v2 on ESP32-2432S024C, TOUCH NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED. 

## Install instructions

Visit the [webflasher](https://jbman2025.github.io/Nerdminer-v2-esp32-2432s024c-screen-fix-flash/) and click Connect

## NerdMiner configuration

After flashing, you will only need to setup your Wifi and BTC address.

Note: When the BTC address of your selected wallet is not provided, mining will not start.

#### Wifi Accesspoint


1. Connect to NerdMinerAP
   - AP: NerdMinerAP
   - PASS: MineYourCoins
2. Set up your Wifi Network
3. Add your BTC address

   - If you are using public-pool.io and you want to set a custom name to your worker you can append a string with format _.yourworkername_ to the address

To remotely view your miner's progress, visit: [web.public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io/#/)
